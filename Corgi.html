        <p>a dog has 4 legs, a tail, and a head. They can vary in different sizes. There are different breeds and can do many different things. They can serve in the military and police forces. They can also help guide the blind. They can be used to help with therapy as well. Different breeds can specialize in different things. Some or more muscular than others, some can run faster. My favorite breed is the Corgi and is bred for the sake of rolling. Rolling a Corgi is one of the few life pleasures.
